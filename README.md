## Hardware Requirements

This projects generates audio waveform that carries the control signal for the PixMob LED Wristbands. The audio signal is then transmitted using the IR Blaster on your phone. Currently, only audio-based IR Blaster is supported:

* For iPhone (Lightning/Type-C) users, most available IR Blaster on the market should work.
* If you don't have iOS devices, consider using a 3.5mm audio jack IR blaster on other devices (e.g. your laptop).
